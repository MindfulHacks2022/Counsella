# Counsella

### What is Counsella?
Problem
* In between therapy sessions, a challenge would be engaging with clients. How can we develop some form of client progress tracking tool which engages and leads to better quality of therapy and increased clinical outcomes?

Solution
* Counsella - a chatbot that serves as your 24/7 counsellor, as a safe space for emotional offloading. Counsella also runs sentiment analysis on the client’s response and provides suitable evidence-based interventions. 
Counsella can also be used as a tracking tool for real counsellors to check in on the client’s progress and emotional journey during the next visit

Rationale
* Value provided by providing interactive interface for users between sessions, with the AR virtual rant buddy /  therapist visually providing feedback as they rant
* Wanted to make use of new technologies AR to make the application more engaging. We also used an open source web based AR to make it accessible as no app needs to be downloaded to use the application.

Whats next
* Implementing the sentiment analysis to analyse the rants
* Adding more models to make the application more interactive
* Implementing backend to connect therapists to their client rants for more comprehensive sessions and covering rant topics

# Appendix 

## Notes
For the testing codes in the AmesARtest folder:
* the arTestV2.html allows us to import a simple obj model to AR using AFrame. It uses a default marker called a hiro
* aframeTestv1.html contains code to arbitrarily place some 3D objects in a scene (unsure how to trigger the VR part)
* threejs example works, references external script
