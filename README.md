## Notes
For the testing codes in the AmesARtest folder:
* the arTestV2.html allows us to import a simple obj model to AR using AFrame. It uses a default marker called a hiro
* aframeTestv1.html contains code to arbitrarily place some 3D objects in a scene (unsure how to trigger the VR part)
* threejs example works, references external script
